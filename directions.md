# When I Work Full Stack Code Challenge

## Overview:
You will be building a mini When I Work restful API! When completed, you should be able to use
the API to view, create, edit, and delete a shift.
Feel free to use any libraries/frameworks that will help you complete the project.
Please provide a means for someone to checkout your project and run it.

## Requirements:

### List shifts

The API should be able to list all shifts ordered by the start time. It should be able to restrict the
shifts returned by the start and end time.

### View a shift

The API should be able to view a single shift by id.

### Create a shift

The API should allow a user to create a new shift. A shift cannot overlap with any existing shift
for the same user.

### Edit a shift

The API should allow editing the start or end time of any shift. No other fields are editable. The
same time requirements for creating a shift also apply.

### Delete a shift

The API should be able to delete any shift.

## Bonus
You may go above and beyond by implementing any of the following features. This will allow us
to better assess your capabilities, but is not required. Incompletion of these items will not
negatively impact the evaluation of the challenge.

● Add a UI
● Add an authentication/authorization system
● Add a user system with manager and employee roles
● Add similar API operations for users
● Restrict Shift operations based on user role
● Host the project somewhere
● Unit/Functional testing
● Postman file
● API documentation
Submission Requirements:
● Please complete this challenge within 5 days of receipt.
● Challenges that use a code generator to complete the challenge will not be accepted.
